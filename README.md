# FX-Test

FX-Test is a library to implement JUnit-Test for JavaFX applications

## Why FX-Test

FX-Test is similar to [TestFX][1] in its purpose but unfortunately because of license problems it is not suitable for
[Eclipse.org][3] projects like [e(fx)clipse][4].

# Other OpenSource JavaFX TestFrameworks / Tools

* [TestFX][1] - JUnit Test Library similar to FX-Test
* [Jubula][2] - Test Tool with a visual Test-Designer
